benh & paranoidtruth's phils install guide

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This setup is for a win/linux combo (COLD) wallet setup.  
- If you have zero experience with linux, you can still make it through, but you should strongly consider the free
- vps hosting setup service that phils provides so you don't have to!!!
- take a look in the hosting-free-node-install channel
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

************************************ WINDOWS (or mac) go to your local(windows) wallet ***********************************
You should send all of your coins to your windows wallet from the exchange.  
send to your primary/default address (you can find it in file->receiving addresses.  
You need slightly over 12000 coins to cover the fees.

Wait until your coins arrive & are confirmed (can verify confirmed in the transactions tab)
Go to File->receiving addresses.
Create a new address, label it MN1.
Send exactly 12000 coins to that address.  You are just sending coins to yourself at a secondary wallet address. 
ONE TRANSACTION.  EXACTLY 12000.  Do NOT add in extra to cover the fees!
Wait for a few confirms in the transactions tab, the full amount won’t show, but the fee will.

Open the console: Tools->debug console.
Type: masternode outputs
You should get output that looks something like this:
"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" : "0"
Copy & save this to a file, you will need in a minute.
The first part is your txid.  The second part is your index.  

If that didn’t work, stop, you’re already broken.  
Did you send exactly 12000 coins? 12000.1 is not 12000, most common mistake is people send extra coins to their MN address.  Your primary can have the extra, your MN needs exactly 12000.   

In the debug console, type:
masternode genkey
copy/save that output to a file.  Don’t lose it, you will need it for the VPS setup
You will use the genkey & txid in just a minute for window conf...

Now edit two windows conf files, just use notepad.  
Find conf files in: c:\users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\Philscurrency
Open the philscurrency.conf:
Make it look exactly like this (replace with your own pass)
rpcuser=phils
rpcpassword=any_random_string_here_you_do_not_need_to_remember_it
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=36002
addnode=52.14.182.71:36003
addnode=13.59.107.218:36003
addnode=52.14.113.155:36003

Save it.

Open the masternode.conf file (use notepad).
Make it look exactly like this, but swap out your vps IP, genkey, and txid from above
Also, your index which was probably 0
MN1 YOURIP:36003 your_genkey_goes_here your_tx_id_goes_here 0

that's it, that file only needs 1 line (unless you have 2 MN, then it will have 2 lines, etc).
Save it.

Close the wallet and re-open to load the new configs.
Go back to the console:
masternode start-alias MN1
It should start!
do this to check it's windows status:
masternode list-conf
you want to see ENABLED


************************ LINUX VPS SETUP SECTION *****************************************
Follow the LINUX directions from: http://www.philscurrency.com/documentation/
But STOP immediately after you login with PUTTY (or terminal if using a mac).  
DO NOT DO ANY OTHER STEPS FROM THAT GUIDE
From that point on, follow this guide
copy-paste all commands EXACTLY as written (right click will paste into linux)
Lines with a # in front are just comments/notes
***************************************************************************************** 

#download our user script:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paranoidtruth/phils_install/master/add_user.sh

#we are going to use the script to add a user, something like philsadmin, keep it simple, no spaces/special charcters
#you can skip all the name/phone,etc, just hit enter
sh add_user.sh

#now, you should be logged in as that new user, and we download and run the install script:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paranoidtruth/phils_install/master/phils_install.sh
sudo chmod +x phils_install.sh
sh phils_install.sh
#you WILL NEED your genkey you created in the windows steps, copy it, right click to paste when asked for it
#enter y at the end to enable firewall

#your wallet should now be running, verify:
philscurrency-cli getmininginfo

#look at the block count.  we need to let it sync up to the current blockcount of phils, 
#you can verify the block count @ http://explorer.philscurrency.com:3001/
#take a break, let the wallet sync.  Then check the block count again:
philscurrency-cli getmininginfo
#once the block count is up to date, continue....

#verify masternode is running, you want a status of "successfully started"
philscurrency-cli masternode status

#what if it doesn't show active???
#DEBUG RULES:
if it doesn't show active and instead get something like "waiting for activation..."
wait a couple minutes, try status again
if not, go back to windows and shut-down, restart wallet.
Do all of the following in the windows wallet debug/console:
masternode start-alias MN1 (use whatever you named your MN)
verify it's enabled in: masternode list-conf
see that it's showing enabled in: masternode list  
If everything is good there, try again in LINUX VPS:
philscurrency-cli masternode status
if it's still not good, stop and restart it in the VPS:
philscurrency-cli stop
philscurrencyd
still not good?  Wait 5 min and repeat all debug steps.  


#SUCCESS:
#once that is all good, we can do an extra (optional) check in the LINUX VPS:
#swap in YOUR txId from windows for xxxx
philscurrency-cli masternode list | grep xxxx
#with any luck you will see something like: xxxx : ENABLED

#at that point you should be good, 
#double check in masternodes.online, search by IP or MN Address (pub key)
#might take a couple minutes to show up there

#FYI: HELPFUL commands in the VPS:
philscurrencyd #starts wallet/masternode 
philscurrency-cli stop #stops 
philscurrency-cli masternode status #you want a status of successfully started
philscurrency-cli masternode debug
philscurrency-cli masternode list #shows all nodes
philscurrency-cli getmininginfo #show blocks, etc.
philscurrency-cli help #shows every possible command
philscurrency-cli masternode list | grep your_tx_id

#HELPFUL IN WINDOWS CONSOLE
masternode start-alias MN1
masternode list
masternode list-conf

#wait for rewards, at least 24 hours.
#Also, now that your MN is running, good time to backup your windows wallet.dat file to a usb drive, etc!
